# gorkscrew
This is a port of the [corkscrew](https://github.com/corkscrew/corkscrew) utility to Go. I needed a way to deal with making SSH connect via a corporate proxy, and didn't want to deal with trying to set up a build toolchain in my Windows environment. With Go, I can easily cross-compile from Linux.

TODO: Publish release binaries?
